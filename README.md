# TeamMaker
A program to sort a CSV file containing stats of Ultimate Frisbee players (player number, rating, height, gender) for a Hat tournament. Ideally it will sort the players into groups that are evenly matched. It uses an algorithm that first sorts the list of players by gender, rating and height, and then pulls players in a snake pattern into new teams. It then prints the teams, the total player stats sum and average, and the averages of the individual teams. In the future I would like to use the FindAverage method to inform the algorithm about which team is the weakest and needs to take a stronger player from the list.
